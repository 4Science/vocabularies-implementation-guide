The continuous review update and maintenance of the COAR Controlled Vocabularies and their adoption by the most commonly used open repository software is a way to enhance the interoperability across repositories and with other related systems such as harvesters, CRIS systems, data repositories and publishers. COAR Controlled Vocabularies COAR actively works towards the alignment of repository networks and other systems via technical and semantic interoperability, as well as common approaches to policy and services. In 2014, COAR established the Interest Group \"Controlled Vocabularies for Repository Assets\" to develop a set of controlled vocabularies for the bibliographic metadata elements used in records describing research outputs. The COAR Controlled Vocabularies are governed and maintained by the Editorial Board. In order to define the controlled vocabularies, the Editorial Board analyzes existing vocabularies and dictionaries and will use the most appropriate existing terms whenever possible. In the case where there are gaps, new terms are defined by the group. The COAR Controlled Vocabularies are described in SKOS. In SKOS, concepts are identified using URIs, labels to the concepts are uniquely offered in multiple languages, notes allow for description, as well as different annotations and concepts from other vocabularies can be linked. Workflow and web-based editorial processes are managed on VocBench. The URL prefix http://purl.org/coar is reserved as the namespace for the concepts of the COAR Controlled Vocabularies.
